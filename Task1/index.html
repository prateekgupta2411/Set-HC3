            <p>Liliaceae Tulip is a member of the lily family, Liliaceae, along with 14 other genera.
              where it is most closely related to Amana, Erythronium, and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae. 
              There are about 75 species, and these are divided among four subgenera. The name "tulip"
              is thought to be derived from a Persian word for turban, which it may have been thought
              to resemble.Tulips originally were found in a band stretching from Southern Europe to 
              Central Asia, but since the seventeenth century have become widely naturalized and 
              cultivated.<br>
              In their natural state, they are adapted to steppes and mountainous areas with 
              temperate climates. Flowering in the spring, they become dormant in the summer once the 
              flowers and leaves die back, emerging above ground as a shoot from the underground bulb 
              in early spring.Text from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip</a>
