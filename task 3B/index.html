                <p>Many published books use a device to separate certain paragraphs further
                    when there is a change of scene or time. This extra space, especially when 
                    co-occurring at a page or section break, may contain a special symbol known as a dinkus,

                <p>We fought our battle of freedom with the Britishers, many nationalists and freedom 
                    fighters were part of that movement. We cannot forget the contribution of a great
                    leader Neta Ji Subhash Chandra Bose, who also known as Neta Ji was a great Indian 
                    nationalist born on 23rd of January 1897 in Cuttack. He was also a great freedom 
                    fighter who fought with bravery. Subhash Chandra Bose supported for the complete 
                    independence of India. Subhash Chandra Bose was against the non-violence scheme 
                    of Mahatma Gandhi. He was a violence support nationalist. In this article, 
                    we have drafted a few sets of 10 lines on Subhash Chandra Bose, which is going to 
                    help you to know him better.</p>
